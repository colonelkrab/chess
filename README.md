The main goal of this project was to learn rust and finish it without using any libraries other than macroquad. Another goal was to come up with an implementation of Chess on my own. Therefore, I did not look up the standard ways to implement it. Ofc my implementation ended up being messy and lengthy. There are lot of optimizations that can be done in many places and also a lot of code to clean up. I might revisit this project in the future to do those things, but for now its done.
